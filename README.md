## Graceful Degradation & Service Workers
Graceful degradation is an approach where an application is built to its full capability first and then designed to fall back gracefully when certain features or resources are unavailable. Service Workers enable this by intercepting network requests and serving cached content when the network is slow or offline, ensuring the core functionality of the app remains intact. When the network returns, the Service Worker can fetch fresh data and update the cache, seamlessly bridging the gap between the ideal experience and limited connectivity.
